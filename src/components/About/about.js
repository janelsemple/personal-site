          Hello, and welcome to my site! In 2021 I had had enough of serving tables, and decided to take a
          leap of faith and go back to school. Two years later, I have achieved my diploma in Information Technology
          with a major in software development from The Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. I am now looking for
          a job in the IT industry, and I am excited to see where my new career will take me. I love to learn about all
          things tech, and I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself.

          I am also constantly listening to music, check out what I am listening to right now!
